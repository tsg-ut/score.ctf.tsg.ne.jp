They are named **\"Beginner's XXX\"** and released at the same time as the CTF begins.\r\n* Beginner's Tasks are not \"beginner-level problems.\" We define a beginner's task as a challenge that does not require any experience or knowledge specific to CTF, but can be solved with knowledge that even a beginner has. So please don't be discouraged if you can't solve a \"beginner's task\". At times it can be hard!\r\n\r\n## Release Schedule\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This schedule is tentative. We will make the best effort to deliver these challenges as planned. However any changes are expected anytime.\r\n\r\n**Time (UTC)**|**Genre**|**Difficulty**|**Author**\r\n:------|:------|:------|:------\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Sanity|warmup|-\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Pwn|beginner|@moratorium08\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Crypto|beginner|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Web|beginner|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Web|beginner|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Rev|beginner|@m1kit\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Misc|easy|@m1kit\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|Pwn|med-hard|_@azatorium08_\r\n10\u002F02 07:00|PPC|medium|@naan4UGen\r\n10\u002F02 08:00|Pwn|easy|@moratorium08\r\n10\u002F02 08:00|Crypto|med-hard|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 09:00|Pwn|medium|@smallkirby\r\n10\u002F02 09:00|Rev|medium|@ishitatsuyuki\r\n10\u002F02 10:00|Web|easy-med|@lmt_swallow\r\n10\u002F02 10:00|Rev|easy|@dai\r\n10\u002F02 11:00|Misc|medium|@m1kit\r\n10\u002F02 11:00|Pwn|hard|@moratorium08\r\n10\u002F02 11:00|PPC|hard|@naan4UGen\r\n10\u002F02 12:00|Crypto|easy|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 12:00|Crypto|medium|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 13:00|Pwn|medium|@moratorium08\r\n10\u002F02 13:00|Web|med-hard|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 14:00|Crypto|easy|@naan4UGen\r\n10\u002F02 14:00|Misc|easy|@jp3bgy\r\n10\u002F02 15:00|Pwn|easy|@moratorium08\r\n10\u002F02 15:00|Misc|medium|@hakatashi\r\n10\u002F02 23:00|Survey|cooldown|-\r\n\r\nAbout **Survey** challenge: This is a special \"challenge\" where you can earn 1pt as a bonus by answering a survey about this CTF.
